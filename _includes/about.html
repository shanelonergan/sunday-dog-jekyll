                <h2>Sunday</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the personal website of Sunday Dog, a.k.a The Big Stinky Baby. Sunday lives in an apartment with her wonderful parents and her best friend on the floor below. She loves the dog park and the woods, she loves gimmie that shoe, and she loves going to play care. Most of her time is spent sitting on her parents feet as they cook dinner and then patiently waiting for a frozen bone sitting up in her bed. Every night she has to go into her crate but one day when she’s older she’ll be able to sleep in our room. She asks every night just in case.
                    Some naughty things she’s allowed to do are dig holes and some naughty things she isn’t allowed to do but does anyway is destroy things made of paper. Words she knows include: food, treat, Sunday come, sit, good girl, and crate. Words she does not know include: No.</p>
